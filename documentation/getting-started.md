## Installation 

Follow the [Install Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/installation.html) to set up PyChaste.

If you are not using Docker you should be able to launch a Python session and do:
    
    import chaste
    chaste.init()

## Tutorials

Next follow [the tutorials]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/tutorials.html). It is recommended that you follow them in a Jupyter notebook, with pre-populated notebooks linked to from each tutorial. 

If you are using a Docker image you should see a list of tutorials in your browser on launch, it is recommended you follow them in the order described [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/tutorials.html).
