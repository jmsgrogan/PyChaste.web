It is recommended that you follow the tutorials in the provided order. 

## Demo Problems

These tutorials demonstrate some applications of biological interest, but do not discuss functionality in detail.

* [Simulating a Scratch Assay]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/tutorials/TestScratchAssayTutorial.html)  - setting up a simple cellular automaton, 3D visualization and real-time plotting.

* [Simulating Spheroid Growth]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/tutorials/TestSpheroidTutorial.html)  - setting up an off-lattice cell population and reaction-diffusion PDEs.

* [Simulating a Epithelial Sheet Tensile Test]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/tutorials/TestTensileTestTutorial.html)  - setting up a Vertex based cell population and using polymorphism for time varying boundary conditions. 

* [Simulating Cell Sorting]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/tutorials/TestCellSorting.html)  - setting up a Potts based simulation and labelling cells.


## Basic Simulations

These tutorials demonstrate basic functionality. They are based on the C++ versions in [Chaste](https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk). See the [Chaste User Tutorials](https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/wiki/UserTutorials) page for more detailed information.

* [Running Mesh Based Simulations]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/tutorials/TestMeshBasedCellSimulationsPythonTutorial.html)  - the simplest (and first to be implemented in Chaste) type of cell-based simulation.

* [Running Node Based Simulations]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/tutorials/TestNodeBasedCellSimulationsPythonTutorial.html) - includes details of how to simplify cell-based tests.

* [Running Vertex Based Simulations]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/tutorials/TestVertexBasedCellSimulationsPythonTutorial.html) - includes adding boundary conditions and removing cells from simulations. 

* [Running Potts Based Simulations]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/tutorials/TestPottsBasedCellSimulationsPythonTutorial.html) - lattice-based simulations.
