It is recommended that you follow the tutorials in the provided order in a Jupyter notebook. Notebooks are linked to from each tutorial. These tutorials are based on the C++ versions in [Chaste](https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk). See the [Chaste User Tutorials](https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/wiki/UserTutorials) page for more detailed information.

## Running basic simulations:
* [Running Mesh Based Simulations]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/md_tutorials/TestMeshBasedCellSimulationsPythonTutorial.html)  - the simplest (and first to be implemented in Chaste) type of cell-based simulation, start here. [Jupyter Notebook]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/md_tutorials/TestMeshBasedCellSimulationsPythonTutorialNotebook.html)
* [Running Node Based Simulations](https://github.com/jmsgrogan/PyChaste/wiki/TestNodeBasedCellSimulationsPythonLiteratePaper) - includes details of how to simplify cell-based tests.
* [Running Vertex Based Simulations](https://github.com/jmsgrogan/PyChaste/wiki/TestVertexBasedCellSimulationsPythonLiteratePaper) - includes adding boundary conditions and removing cells from simulations
* [Running Potts Based Simulations](https://github.com/jmsgrogan/PyChaste/wiki/TestPottsBasedCellSimulationsPythonLiteratePaper) - lattice-based simulations
